Question 1

1.You have just joined IxD Systems as a junior systems engineer. On your first day, the Linux administrator asks you to perform a basic environment verification on the lab machine using your own login account.
User Identity Verification: Display your currently logged-in username and all groups your user account belongs to. Your name or login ID must appear in the output.

Answer. To verify my identity on the system, I ran whoami to see my username and followed up with the id command to view my unique User ID (UID) and complete list of group memberships.
Command: whoami and id

2.Workspace Validation: Display the current working directory and list all files and directories in that location using long format listing.

Answer. To confirm my location in the file system, I ran pwd to print the current working directory, then used ls -l to generate a detailed list of the files and folders there, showing their sizes, owners, and permissions.
Command: pwd and ls -l
